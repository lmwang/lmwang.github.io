Continous Integration (CI) is a best practise from Agile. But it can also be used for other projects not using Agile process. It's an easy and most valuble practise in software development cycle. 
Generally speaking, the duration between kick off CI build to get report should not exceed 20min. If it takes longer, user may not willing to use it. Build manager should check if possible to reduce time by checking the parallel build and distributing build.
